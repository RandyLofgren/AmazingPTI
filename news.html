                        Miller Persson. In a match up of what many refer to as the biggest paddle rivalry in the history
                        of the South, Claes started
                        out hot in both sets but his kill shots quickly turned into suicide shots as Nathan unleashed a
                        plethora of around the net digs. With Crick's forehand now in Mid-Season form, Mark Fischl was
                        heard on the APTA Live Stream referring to John Hughes as the "Nathan Crick of the North".

                        With tonight's format of 1&4 vs 2&3 and 5&8 vs 6&7, the stage was set for the closest PTI match
                        seen thus far in "The League". Phillips as a 12.37 paired with Leffke at 16.87 against Weston at
                        13.59 and Beecher at 14.88. That's right, Beecher and Weston come in at a combined .77 PTI
                        favorite, basically a pick-em. Leffke coming off two recent wins over the team of Beecher and
                        Weston, was unable to get his feet under him as he and Phillips stared the PTI in the eyes and
                        shouted "No!"

                    <p class="news-article"> Tommy Beecher's ascendence to the top of League Standings has not gone
                        unnoticed, but it does bring with it, many questions. The first of these is, who the hell is
                        this
                        guy. A quick background check revealed a few key facts that led to his impressive early season
                        run. While in college, Tommy was a quarterback at USC(not the real one in California), where his
                        teammates
                        referred to him as Jeff Garcia's personal assistant. After graduating college, Tommy went on to
                        captain a USTA League Team that won the National Championship in what is believed to be
                        a competition of who is best at tanking matches during the regualr season to keep their rating
                        down. The real question however, is this guy a real contender to win the league title or will
                        he fade away into the background as the season progresses?
                    </p>
                    <p class="news-article">
                        In unrelated news, League Fees will be increased by 20% moving forward due to the increased
                        alcohol consumption over the last two weeks, in what local experts are referring to as the
                        "Chris Steyl Effect". Starting
                        this coming Wednesday, the League Fee will go from $5 per night to $6 per night. Finally, I feel
                        obligated to mention Claes continued his dominance as he went 3-0 on the night, hitting enough
                        kill shots to label the event as a "Mass Shooting". Look for him to have a potentially tough
                        week
                        moving forward with the expected return of Nathan "Nate Dogg" Crick.

                    <p class="news-article"> The third week of Randy's Amazing PTI Platform League has come and gone.
                        The night began with
                        uncertainty as Tropical Storm Zeta caused chaos on the Charlote Paddle Scene. In what can only
                        be described as an unbelievably shocking turn of events, Lofgren went from "Hero" to "Zero" as
                        fast as Claese could slash, cut, drop, and kill his way to victory, but certainly not to be
                        confused with "Absolute Zero", a rare feat achieved by two league members the previous week.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news-article">
                        Joining Lofgren in the "Loser's Lounge" was Chris Steyl, who ran into the buzzsaw and current #2
                        in League Standing, Tom Weston. Tom is only 2nd to Nathan "Nate Dogg" Crick, the only player to
                        put up 2 League Points each night. Play continues next week as Claes begins to find his form
                        with the weight of "tied for last place" off his shoulders. Look for a wild night as random
                        chance will play a large role in the outcome next Wednesday!

                        Platform League is in the books! While Claes continued to fail at gaining any league points on
                        Court 1, the majority of the action took place on Court 2. Niclas Nilsson, The Biggest Swede in
                        the South partnered with Robert "Suns Out Guns Out" Phillips to take on Tom "What's a Drive?"
                        Weston and Randy "Just Say Uncle and I'll Make it Stop" Lofgren in what turned out to be a
                        disaster of a night for Nilsson and Phillips.
                    </p>
                    <p class="news-article">
                        Weston lobbed and Lofgren watched as the meltdown
                        unfolded. The 6-0, 6-0 victory from Weston/Lofgren led to a heated debate on the eligibility of
                        Nilsson and Phillips in week 3. Ultimately, pitty and guilt led the league organizers to their
                        decision to allow Robert and Nic another week in the league.
